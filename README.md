# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to use Tableau to make visualizations from the different types of analyses made on the dataset based on the questions that were formulated. Also, to create an interactive dashboard for an effective presentation.

## Process
### 1. Download and import dataset
### 2. Verify data types in each fields
### 3. Conduct initial visualizations to understand the dataset
### 4. Formulate questions 
### 5. Create dashboard


## Results

I have chosen option 2 and the data set is the Federal Aviation Administration Wildlife Strikes Dataset from 2000 to 2015.
I want to answer the following questions about the dataset:
## 1. Which state has the highest number of wildlife strikes ?

I created a map to see in which states most incidents occurred. The map provides a quick overview of the spread of the total number of strikes because of the color gradient which enables a quick scan of the states with high numbers.

The state of California recorded the highest number of wildlife strikes.

## 2. Which wildlife category was the most responsible for those incidents ?

I made a pie chart because from the data I could see we have only 4 wildlife animal categrories and this type of visualization is very convenient to show this data in percentage values.

Birds were mostly responsible for the strikes across states.

## 3. Top N species in this category ?

I have used a bar chart with slide filters to select the top N species responsible for causing the accidents. The bar chart is an effective tool here to easily interpret the result. Also, we can see a clear relationship between size and value.

The Mourning Dove caused the highest number of strikes in California



## 4. In which phase of the flight did the strikes happened most often and to what extent did they cause damage ?

Again,  I created a bar chart which shows the number of accidents by each phase of flight. I have used a filter to show the extent of damage which are divided into five categories and are each represented by a color on each bar. I can play around the filter to show the extent of damage for each phase of flight.

Most incidents occured in the approach phase.

## 5. What is the trend of the incidents over the years ?

To see the trend of the number of strikes I created a line chart and a moving average line chart. I included a trend line. The moving average is highly effective in showing the pattern and  trend over time more clearly as it smoothes out fluctuations in data values. 

The trend line is upward sloping, which means number of strikes has been increasing over the years.

## 6. Forecast for number of strikes and cost of damage ?

I created a line chart to plot the number of strikes and cost of damage over the years and the forecast for the next two years. The line chart emphasizes the changes and direction in the data. I created a filter that allows me to either see the cost of damage or number of strikes over the years. Also, the trend in numbers is represented by different colored lines representing what time of the day the incidents occurred most. I have also included a reference line representing the average. 

From the observation, number of incidents will continue to rise while cost of damage shows a constant trend. Also, number of strikes and cost are highest for strikes that happened during the day. These numbers are above the average.




## Challenges 
I had a difficult time using containers. I was not able to resize my charts without affecting other charts. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would have liked to perform more in-depth analyses and data visualizations. I would like to make complex calculations by using LOD expressions. I woud like to further develop my skills in creating interesting and interactive dashboards.
